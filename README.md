# Cursor Landing Page Clone

This project is a **desktop-first visual recreation** of the Cursor developer tool landing page, built as part of the **Web Dev Cohort 2026 – HTML & CSS assignment**.

The goal of this assignment was to closely match the **layout, typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy** of the original Cursor website, without adding any custom creativity or interactivity.
